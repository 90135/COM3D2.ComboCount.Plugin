# COM3D2.ComboCount.Plugin

This seems to be a plugin for COM3D2 that allows you to undress maids based on combo counts in dance rhythm mode

A friend of mine wanted it, so I forked and compiled it

<br>

## How to use   

1. Download
2. Put the `COM3D2.ComboCount.Plugin.dll` file in `COM3D2\Sybaris\UnityInjector\`
3. Put the `ComboCount.xml` file in `COM3D2\Sybaris\UnityInjector\Config\`


Original readme :

```
■これは何
	ダンスでコンボ数に応じて着替えたり脱いだりします
	ComboCount.xmlにそれっぽく設定してください

■
	改造・再配布はご自由にどうぞ
```

`改造・再配布はご自由にどうぞ` So I should be able to distribute it
